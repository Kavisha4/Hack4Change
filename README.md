# Multilingual Education Enhancer

## Introduction

Today's online education doesnâ€™t encompass learning modules in the various Indian languages. Our aim is to bridge the gap in Online Learning Platforms to students from various vernacular backgrounds in India and give them access to educational resources.

## Objectives

Our motive is to have:
1. Multilingual learning with translational capabilities, with engaging learning content
2. Skills assessment and personalised recommendations
3. Summarised version of a textbook or PDF
4. New transcript/Closed captions in vernacular language

## Target Consumers

Students from different vernacular backgrounds.

## How We Plan to Achieve This

1. Process the existing English lectures, audios and videos
2. Generate subtitles for the video using AI and create a corpus of transcripts along with timestamps
3. Use NLP to identify and categorise the transcript into important topics
4. Save timestamps corresponding to the topics identified
5. Perform a translation of the corpus into the preferred language
6. Integrate the translated vernacular into a single transcript
7. Create a new audio in the specified vernacular language
8. Sync the new transcript along with new dubbed audio

## Progress So Far
